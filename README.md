## Overview

<!-- ![screenshot](https://github.com/ImieboGodson/DevChallenges-checkout-page/blob/master/resources/images/checkout-page%20desktop-view.png) -->


 This project was done as part of a course from [zerotomastery](https://zerotomastery.io/) taught by [Jacinto Wong](https://github.com/JacintoDesign).  This project is part of my process of understanding Javascript and using it to solve real world problems.


### Built With

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This project is built around the concept of fetching data from web APIs. In this case we are getting random quote from the [Random Quote API](https://forismatic.com/en/api/) using the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and the [async await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) syntax.

I also used the [Twitter API docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) while building the Tweet button for this project.

And finally, This project is also fully responsive.
